> - **Week 3:** Exams & Optional Lectures
> - **Week 4:** Project Week

# <u>Course Expectations</u>

## <u>Assignments</u>

1. Focus on Core and Practice Assignments!
> There will be a lot of Optional assignments. It's recommended to only do these when you are ahead, or it's after Exams and you want to learn more!

2. AP Check's are performed each week to see if you are on track with Core Assignment completion. 
> Your AP is based on Attendance and Core Assignment completion, so prioritize those! 
> Also keep an eye out for assignments being 'flagged' as pending review. This means an assignment has been checked and found incorrect. 
> The assignment is flagged for: 
>> - Incomplete
>> - Incorrect Assignment
>> - Does not Run

3. Node Modules Folders and what to know about them! (Will be reviewed again in the future!)
>node_modules will be featured in most assignments, and they are rather large. So it's best to avoid keeping those on your Windows Desktop or else it may sync with OneDrive and use up storage.
>> Delete node_modules folders before submitting assignments/uploading to Github! (Can use .gitignore file for this)

## <u>Lectures</u>

1. Read the Learn Platform Material before the Lecture
2. Ask questions and don't struggle in silence!
3. Lectures are informed by the Learn Platform 
4. Although the Learn Platform is your primary source, you may need to do your own research for solving some of the assignments/debugging!
5. Webcams are very much encouraged!

## <u>Academic Honesty</u>

❌Do not plagiarize assignments. (Leads to more APs!)
❌Do not plagiarize exams. (Automatic Expulsion!)
❌Do not use AI or AI VSCode Extensions to complete assignments/exams!
✔️ You can program with cohort-mates, but try to remember to make a note of this for assignment checking in your code! (With a comment)

---
## Code Reviews
- 2 Code Reviews before Exam (1 Review is required to take the Exam!)
- Core assignments only, they can be nearly completed assignments!
- Goal: Improve code quality/give feedback on particular assignments.

## Remember the 20 Minute Rule!
Sources of assistance:
- Your cohort!
- Instructor/TA
- TA Hall (8 - 9 AM | Open until 7 PM MST)
Goal: Building the tools to be self-sufficient and not only pursuing answers!
